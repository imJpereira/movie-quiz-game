# Movie Quiz Game

This project is a fun and interactive quiz game focused on movie trivia. The questions are sourced from the Open Trivia DB, providing a wide range of challenging movie-related questions. For this project, I used the Javascript framework "Vue.js", with Options API.

The questions can delay, due the API limitations. To solve part of this problem, after you submit your answer, you must wait 3 seconds, to not have the error of "too many requests"
